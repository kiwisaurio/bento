# Bento Macropad kiwi's Edition with VIA and backlight


![Bento](https://i.imgur.com/csn46mNl.jpg)


The Bento Macropad is a 5-key macropad with rotary encoder designed by Dwin17 (Discord: **Dwin#3766**, Reddit: **nguyedt**) with PCB designed by coarse (keyboard.coarse.tech). 

**Key features include:**
- Powered by QMK Firmware
- EC11 Rotary Encoder
- RGB Underglow
- VIA support (added by c0qu1)
- Pro Micro microcontroller was upgraded with qmk-dfu bootloader to avoid opening the Bento to press reset, just have to unplugged USB, hold the upper left key and plug it to PC. If your Pro-Micro has the default Caterina bootloader the change is very simple in the rules.mk file, you can also download a precompiled firmware for the Caterina bootloader.
- Added backlight on the firmware and fixed the current via keymap, so you can compile it as you want.

**FAQ**

* Can you post a compiled firmware?
  - https://github.com/kiwisaurio/bento/releases
* Is this project original from kiwisaurio?
  - No. You can find the forked project here: https://github.com/Dwin17/bento and the forked project with VIA addon on https://github.com/c0qu1/bento
  - Also would like to credit @mttpsck on GitHub for the content of the 4 layers
* Is the VIA support working perfectly?
  - Almost, the rotary encoder is not supported by VIA. The firmware provides support for the rotary encoder that works while also supporting VIA on the 4 contiguous keys, and the rotary encoder built in button. The 5th key is used to cycle through all the layers and this is not supported by VIA since it is a custom function in QMK. The layer switching key was removed from the VIA layout to prevent an accidental modification of it.
* Why won't ______ work? 
  - Please see the troubleshooting guide on the original project, see above.
* VIA won't recognize my Bento, why?
  - You must import the keymaps/via/bento.json file into VIA everytime you open VIA, until the Bento Macropad is officially added to VIA this will be required.

**Flashing a new layout**

*Please do not use QMK Configurator to create firmware for the Bento. The Bento located on QMK Configurator is only for the handwired version and will not work*

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make bento:via

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with the [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
